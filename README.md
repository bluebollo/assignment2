NOTE:

I created a new Github account under username "bluebollo" and forked the assignment onto that account. However, I didn't realize that I had a separate Github account under the username "SimplyThePerson" set up on my Macbook. So, commits/pushes are shown under "SimplyThePerson", but these two accounts are both mine.
